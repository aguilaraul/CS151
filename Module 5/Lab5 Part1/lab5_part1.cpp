 * CS 151 3228 Module 5 Lab 5 Part 1
 * Create a class that tracks memberships in a gym.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Create a function named visit that increments the number of
 * visits for a member and for the gym.
 * 2. Create a vector of pointers to Member structure
 * 3. Create a Member object using the new operator and add pointers to
 * four members
 * 4. Delete the pointer to Charlie's Member object from the vector
 * 5. Delete Charlie's Member object from the heap
 * 6. For each of the three remaining members generate a random number
 * between 5 and 20, and call the visit function for that member that
 * many times
 * 7. Print a report which loops through the vector printing each
 * members id, name, number of visits, and monthly rate.
 * 8. Print the total number of visits to the gym and the number of
 * active members.
